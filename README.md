Contribution & Build
===============
The source is under the `lib` dir, do your changes to the files under that directory.
The `build` should NOT be changed by hand, because browserify will override your changes.

**To build the src:**
- `cd` to the project root directory
- First install the dependencies by running `$ npm install`
- `$ npm run build`
- And that's it!
